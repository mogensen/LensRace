# 🎯 LensRace

Multiplayer mobile web game where players race to photograph objects from a shared
list using on-device image recognition. **Go Fiber + SQLite** backend, **Vue.js PWA**
frontend.

See [`PLAN.md`](./PLAN.md) for the full feature set, data model, and roadmap.

> **Status:** early development. Backend skeleton (milestone 1) is in place:
> Fiber server, SQLite with embedded migrations, seeded categories/items, and a
> health check. See `PLAN.md` for the remaining milestones.

## 🔧 Backend (Go Fiber)

All backend commands run from the **repo root**.

### Develop with live reload

The Fiber CLI watches your files and restarts the server on every change:

```sh
fiber dev
```

Useful flags for this project:

```sh
# Watch Go + template files, ignore build/vendor dirs.
fiber dev \
  -e go,tmpl,html \
  -D tmp,vendor,node_modules,dist,frontend
```

| Flag        | Purpose                                              |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `-e`        | Extra file extensions to watch                       |
| `-D`        | Directories to ignore                                |
| `-d`        | Restart debounce delay (e.g. `-d 2s`)                |
| `--pre-run` | Command(s) to run before each restart                |
| `-a`        | Arguments passed to the app (e.g. `-a "-port=8080"`) |
| `-t`        | Build/run target package                             |

### Build & run without the CLI

```sh
go build -o ./bin/server .
./bin/server
```

### Test

```sh
go test ./...
```

The API listens on `:3000` by default and is available at
<http://localhost:3000/api>. On startup it opens (or creates) the SQLite
database and applies any pending migrations automatically — no separate
migrate step is needed.

Available endpoints so far:

| Method | Path                       | Description                                         |
| ------ | -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| GET    | `/api/health`               | Liveness check                                       |
| GET    | `/api/categories`           | List predefined categories                           |
| POST   | `/api/games`                 | Create a game (body: `categoryId`, `hostName`, optional `durationSeconds`) |
| GET    | `/api/games/:id`             | Game state — `:id` accepts either the internal ID or the public join code |
| POST   | `/api/games/:id/join`        | Join a waiting game (body: `name`)                   |
| PATCH  | `/api/games/:id/category`    | Change category while waiting (body: `playerId`, `categoryId`; host only) |
| POST   | `/api/games/:id/start`       | Start the game (body: `playerId`; host only)         |
| POST   | `/api/games/:id/captures`    | Record a captured item (body: `playerId`, `itemId`, optional `confidence`) |
| GET    | `/api/games/:id/events`      | **SSE** stream of the full game state on every change (status + leaderboard) |

There's no auth/session layer yet — `playerId` is handed back in the create/join
response and the client is expected to hold onto it for `start`/`captures` calls.
A game auto-finishes when its `durationSeconds` elapses or when a player
captures every item in the category. Expiry is detected proactively by a
background watcher (checks an in-memory cache every second, so SSE clients see
the `finished` status pushed to them — no need to poll), not just lazily on the
next request.

The `/events` stream sends an `event: state` message with the full
`GameState` JSON as soon as you connect, then again on every join/start/capture/expiry,
plus a `:` comment line every 25s as a keepalive. There's no event-type
differentiation — decode every `data:` payload as a `GameState`.

### Configuration

| Env var   | Default        | Description                          |
| --------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `PORT`    | `3000`         | HTTP listen port                      |
| `DB_PATH` | `lensrace.db`  | SQLite file path (`:memory:` for tests)|

## 🎨 Frontend (Vue.js PWA)

All frontend commands run from the `frontend/` directory.

```sh
cd frontend
pnpm install      # install dependencies
pnpm dev          # Vite dev server with HMR
pnpm build        # type-check + production build
pnpm preview      # serve the production build locally
pnpm test:e2e     # Playwright end-to-end tests (run `pnpm exec playwright install` first)
pnpm lint         # oxlint + ESLint (--fix)
pnpm format       # Prettier
```

The dev server proxies `/api` to the backend on `:3000` (configured in
`vite.config.ts`).

Scaffolded with `create-vue` (TypeScript, Vue Router, ESLint+Prettier,
Playwright) plus Tailwind CSS v4 via `@tailwindcss/vite`. The UI implements
the "Snap Hunt" design end-to-end against the real backend — no mock data —
using the app's own game state and lobby/timer/leaderboard, not the design
prototype's simulated bot opponents.

| Route               | View          | Purpose                                                  |
| -------------------- | -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------|
| `/`                   | `HomeView`     | Create a game or join one with a code                    |
| `/games/:id/lobby`    | `LobbyView`    | Share the join code, host picks category, players + start|
| `/games/:id/play`     | `PlayView`     | Live timer, progress, item list, leaderboard, SNAP button|
| `/games/:id/results`  | `ResultsView`  | Podium, full ranking, confetti, play again                |

Supporting structure:

- `src/lib/api.ts` — typed fetch client for the backend (mirrors `internal/models`), plus an SSE subscription helper.
- `src/stores/game.ts` — a small reactive singleton (not Pinia — unnecessary for this scope) holding the live `GameState`, the current player's id, and the SSE connection; persists `{ gameId, playerId }` to `localStorage` so a page refresh mid-game doesn't lose your identity.
- `src/components/CameraOverlay.vue` — the aim/scan/done capture UI: a real `getUserMedia` feed with TensorFlow.js COCO-SSD running on-device against it every ~400ms, auto-triggering a capture on a sustained match. Tapping the shutter still works as a manual override (useful in poor lighting or for the 80 or so object classes COCO-SSD doesn't recognize).
- `src/lib/detector.ts` — loads TensorFlow.js/COCO-SSD. **Not** an ES import: it injects `<script>` tags pointing at `public/vendor/{tf,coco-ssd}.min.js` (copied from `node_modules` by `scripts/copy-vendor.mjs`, wired into `postinstall`/`predev`/`prebuild-only`). Reason: `tfjs-converter` has a class method literally named `import` (`async import(keys, values) {}`), and Vite's lightweight import-scanner misreads `import(` there as a dynamic-import call, corrupting the file — this happens in Vite's transform pipeline itself, so `optimizeDeps` include/exclude doesn't help. Loading via `<script>` sidesteps Vite's JS transform for these files entirely, and as a bonus keeps the ~1.4MB payload out of the initial bundle (`CameraOverlay` is lazy-loaded and only injects the scripts when the camera actually opens).
- `src/lib/{avatar,itemIcons,categoryIcons}.ts` — small client-side cosmetic lookups (emoji/color) for players/items/categories, since the backend doesn't model those.

One backend addition came out of implementing this design: `PATCH /api/games/:id/category` lets the host change category from the lobby (the design picks category *after* creating the game, not at creation time).

## 🚀 Running the full stack locally

Open two terminals:

```sh
# Terminal 1 — backend with live reload (repo root)
fiber dev

# Terminal 2 — frontend with HMR
cd frontend && pnpm dev
```

Then open the URL printed by Vite (typically <http://localhost:5173>).

---

## 🐳 Production build (Docker)

```sh
docker build -t lensrace .
docker run -p 3000:3000 lensrace
```

The image builds the Vue frontend, embeds the static assets into the Go binary,
and serves both the API and the PWA from the Fiber server.
